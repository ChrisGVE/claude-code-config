- ✅ Session start algorithm review requirement
- ✅ User instruction storage to prevent repetition

#### Sub-Agent Usage Guide
- ✅ When to use sub-agents proactively
- ✅ Mandatory instructions for sub-agents

- ✅ 4-step verification process
- ✅ Common assumption traps listed

### 2. CLAUDE.md.template Updates

- ✅ Updated PRD.md → PRD.txt
- ✅ Added MCP Tool Status checklist
- ✅ Added Unconfirmed Assumptions tracking
- ✅ Added Active Sub-Agents tracking table
- ✅ Added Algorithm Registry (must match ALGO.md)
- ✅ Enhanced todo format with sequential-thinking notation

### 3. CLAUDE_SYSTEM.md Updates

- ✅ Updated PRD.md → PRD.txt
- ✅ Enhanced assumption verification requirements
- ✅ Expanded "Never Assume" section
- ✅ Added 4-step assumption process

## Key Reinforcements Requested vs Delivered

### a) Pro-active sub-agent usage ✅
- Added to Primary Rules
- Created Sub-Agent Usage Guide
- Added tracking in CLAUDE.md template
- Emphasized atomic commits for sub-agents

### b) MCP Tool Usage ✅

1. **PRD with task-master** ✅
   - PRD.txt workflow defined
   - task-master parse-prd integration

2. **Serena initial instructions** ✅
   - First step in session initialization

3. **claude-context indexing** ✅
   - Check indexing status at session start

4. **Context7 for documentation** ✅
   - Use before full documentation

5. **Playwright/Puppeteer/Exa** ✅
   - Web development workflow section

6. **task-master + sequential-thinking** ✅ - CORRECTED: task-master IS the todo system (no separate todos), sequential-thinking for EACH task
   - Integrated in planning workflow

7. **GitHub MCP** ✅
   - Referenced in search workflow

8. **Memory service** ✅
   - Enhanced memory management section
   - User instruction storage

9. **ALGO.md enforcement** ✅
   - MANDATORY storage requirement
   - Memory + ALGO.md dual storage

10. **Container-use for UI** ✅
    - Web development workflow section

### c) Assumption verification ✅
- Added to Primary Rules
- Created dedicated Assumptions section
- 4-step verification process
- Multiple reinforcement points

## Files Modified

1. `CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` - Main system prompt with all reinforcements
2. `CLAUDE.md.template` - Project tracking template with MCP tool tracking
3. `CLAUDE_SYSTEM.md` - Shared immutable instructions with assumption checks

## Critical Corrections Applied

### Tool Hierarchy Fix
- **task-master** is THE primary todo system - NO separate todo lists in any files
- **sequential-thinking** is used FOR each task-master task, not before
- Removed all todo list sections from templates
- Added explicit "Task Management - CRITICAL" section

### Key Points Emphasized
- NEVER create todo lists in CLAUDE.md or other files
- task-master commands: `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `set_task_status`
- Workflow: task-master first → then sequential-thinking for each task

## Commit History
