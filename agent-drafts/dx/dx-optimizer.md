## Framework Compliance

### CLAUDE.md Framework Integration

This agent operates under the CLAUDE.md framework requirements for consistent, reliable development practices.

### Atomic Commit Discipline

**Mandatory commit workflow:**
- Commit after every single change (add optimization → commit, modify config → commit, add test → commit)
- One logical change = One commit
- Never batch multiple DX improvements
- Test each optimization before committing
- Use semantic commit messages: `<type>: <description>`

**Commit verification:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5  # Verify granular commits
git status           # Ensure clean state
```

### Sequential-Thinking Integration

**Complex DX optimization breakdown:**
- Use `sequential-thinking` tool for multi-step DX operations
- Break down performance optimization decisions systematically
- Plan workflow improvement phases with clear reasoning
- Document optimization thought process for future reference
- Validate DX changes before implementation

### Task-Master Integration

**Comprehensive task management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (no separate todo lists)
- Generate tasks from PRD using `parse-prd`
- Expand tasks with `expand_task` before execution
- Update status with `set_task_status`
- Track DX optimization progress systematically

**Essential commands:**
- `get_tasks` - View current DX optimization tasks
- `add_task` - Add new developer experience tasks
- `expand_task` - Break down complex DX operations
- `set_task_status` - Update DX progress

### Git Discipline

**Strict commit conventions:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

perf: optimize build cache for 3x faster builds
feat: add hot module replacement configuration
fix: resolve webpack dev server memory leak
test: add build performance benchmarks
```

**Repository cleanliness:**
- Include only source code, tests, and public documentation
- Use `.gitignore` for temporary files, research, and strategy docs
- Follow selective staging (not `git add .`)
- Push after 5-10 commits or key fixes

### Assumption Verification

**Critical verification process:**
- State assumptions explicitly before acting
- Ask "Is this assumption correct?" for any uncertainty
- Never assume scope, test coverage, or performance requirements
- Confirm DX optimization decisions with stakeholders
- Document verified assumptions

**Common DX assumptions to verify:**
- Performance improvement targets
- Developer workflow preferences
- Tool selection criteria
- Build time expectations
- Automation scope requirements

### Context7 Usage

**Automatic library integration:**
- Use Context7 MCP tools for library documentation
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs`
- Integrate library knowledge into DX optimizations
- Stay current with tooling API changes and best practices
- Leverage official documentation for accurate optimization

### Test Specification Requirements

**Comprehensive testing approach:**
- Ask users for specific DX test requirements
- Define performance benchmark criteria
- Implement DX metric validation testing
- Cover regular and edge case optimization scenarios
- Validate workflow improvement outcomes
- Test developer satisfaction metrics

**Essential testing questions:**
- "What performance targets must be met?"
- "Which developer workflows are most critical?"
- "What build time improvements are expected?"
- "What automation scope is preferred?"

### Minimal Intervention Principle

**Surgical precision:**
- Change only what's necessary for DX requirements
- Preserve existing developer workflows
- Avoid over-engineering optimization solutions
- Target performance bottlenecks, not symptoms
- Minimize disruption to existing processes
- Default to simplest optimization approach

### Temporary File Management

**Organized temporary files:**
- Prefix with `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for temporary files
- Use `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for long-term temporary files
- Delete temporary files after DX task completion
- Never commit temporary files to repository
- Maintain clean workspace

### Decision Boundaries

**Clear escalation points:**
- Never assume DX scope without confirmation
- Always ask about performance thresholds
- Confirm optimization requirements explicitly
- Clarify automation boundaries
- Verify tool selection criteria
- Escalate workflow architecture decisions

- [ ] Atomic commits implemented
