## Framework Compliance

### CLAUDE.md Framework Integration

This agent operates under the CLAUDE.md framework requirements for consistent, reliable development practices.

### Atomic Commit Discipline

**Mandatory commit workflow:**
- Commit after every single change (extract method → commit, rename variable → commit, add test → commit)
- One logical change = One commit
- Never batch multiple refactoring changes
- Test each refactoring step before committing
- Use semantic commit messages: `<type>: <description>`

**Commit verification:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5  # Verify granular commits
git status           # Ensure clean state
```

### Sequential-Thinking Integration

**Complex refactoring breakdown:**
- Use `sequential-thinking` tool for multi-step refactoring operations
- Break down large refactoring tasks systematically
- Plan refactoring phases with clear reasoning
- Document refactoring thought process for future reference
- Validate refactoring approach before execution

### Task-Master Integration

**Comprehensive task management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (no separate todo lists)
- Generate tasks from PRD using `parse-prd`
- Expand tasks with `expand_task` before execution
- Update status with `set_task_status`
- Track refactoring progress systematically

**Essential commands:**
- `get_tasks` - View current refactoring tasks
- `add_task` - Add new refactoring tasks
- `expand_task` - Break down complex refactoring operations
- `set_task_status` - Update refactoring progress

### Git Discipline

**Strict commit conventions:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

refactor: extract user validation method
refactor: rename misleading variable names
test: add characterization tests for legacy code
docs: update API documentation after refactoring
```

**Repository cleanliness:**
- Include only source code, tests, and public documentation
- Use `.gitignore` for temporary files, research, and strategy docs
- Follow selective staging (not `git add .`)
- Push after 5-10 commits or key fixes

### Assumption Verification

**Critical verification process:**
- State assumptions explicitly before acting
- Ask "Is this assumption correct?" for any uncertainty
- Never assume scope, test coverage, or performance requirements
- Confirm refactoring decisions with stakeholders
- Document verified assumptions

**Common refactoring assumptions to verify:**
- Behavior preservation requirements
- Performance impact tolerance
- Test coverage expectations
- Code style preferences
- Architecture constraints

### Context7 Usage

**Automatic library integration:**
- Use Context7 MCP tools for library documentation
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs`
- Integrate library knowledge into refactoring decisions
- Stay current with API changes and best practices
- Leverage official documentation for accurate refactoring

### Test Specification Requirements

**Comprehensive testing approach:**
- Ask users for specific test requirements for refactoring
- Define characterization tests for legacy code
- Implement test-driven refactoring
- Cover regular and edge case conditions
- Validate behavior preservation
- Test performance impact

**Essential testing questions:**
- "What behavior must be preserved exactly?"
- "Which edge cases are critical to maintain?"
- "What performance criteria must be met?"
- "What test coverage level is required?"

### Minimal Intervention Principle

**Surgical precision:**
- Change only what's necessary for code improvement
- Preserve existing functionality completely
- Avoid over-engineering refactoring solutions
- Target code smells, not symptoms
- Minimize disruption to existing workflows
- Default to safest refactoring approach

### Temporary File Management

**Organized temporary files:**
- Prefix with `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for temporary files
- Use `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for long-term temporary files
- Delete temporary files after refactoring task completion
- Never commit temporary files to repository
- Maintain clean workspace

### Decision Boundaries

**Clear escalation points:**
- Never assume refactoring scope without confirmation
- Always ask about performance impact tolerance
- Confirm test coverage requirements explicitly
- Clarify behavior preservation constraints
- Verify architectural change approval
- Escalate design pattern decisions

**Framework compliance verification:**
- [ ] Atomic commits implemented
- [ ] Sequential-thinking utilized
- [ ] Task-master integrated
- [ ] Git discipline followed
