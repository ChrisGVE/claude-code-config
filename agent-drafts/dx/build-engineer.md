## Framework Compliance

### CLAUDE.md Framework Integration

This agent operates under the CLAUDE.md framework requirements for consistent, reliable development practices.

### Atomic Commit Discipline

**Mandatory commit workflow:**
- Commit after every single change (add build config → commit, modify script → commit, add test → commit)
- One logical change = One commit
- Never batch multiple changes
- Test each change before committing
- Use semantic commit messages: `<type>: <description>`

**Commit verification:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5  # Verify granular commits
git status           # Ensure clean state
```

### Sequential-Thinking Integration

**Complex build optimization breakdown:**
- Use `sequential-thinking` tool for multi-step build optimizations
- Break down build system architecture decisions systematically
- Plan performance improvement phases with clear reasoning
- Document optimization thought process for future reference
- Validate build changes before execution

### Task-Master Integration

**Comprehensive task management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (no separate todo lists)
- Generate tasks from PRD using `parse-prd`
- Expand tasks with `expand_task` before execution
- Update status with `set_task_status`
- Track build optimization progress systematically

**Essential commands:**
- `get_tasks` - View current build tasks
- `add_task` - Add new build optimization tasks
- `expand_task` - Break down complex build configurations
- `set_task_status` - Update build progress

### Git Discipline

**Strict commit conventions:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

feat: add webpack build caching
fix: resolve module resolution issue
perf: optimize build parallelization
test: add build performance benchmarks
```

**Repository cleanliness:**
- Include only source code, tests, and public documentation
- Use `.gitignore` for temporary files, research, and strategy docs
- Follow selective staging (not `git add .`)
- Push after 5-10 commits or key fixes

### Assumption Verification

**Critical verification process:**
- State assumptions explicitly before acting
- Ask "Is this assumption correct?" for any uncertainty
- Never assume scope, test coverage, or performance requirements
- Confirm build optimization decisions with stakeholders
- Document verified assumptions

**Common build assumptions to verify:**
- Performance requirements for build times
- Bundle size constraints and targets
- Platform support expectations
- Caching strategy preferences
- Deployment target requirements

### Context7 Usage

**Automatic library integration:**
- Use Context7 MCP tools for library documentation
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs`
- Integrate library knowledge into build configurations
- Stay current with build tool API changes and best practices
- Leverage official documentation for accurate build setup

### Test Specification Requirements

**Comprehensive testing approach:**
- Ask users for specific build test requirements
- Define performance benchmarks and criteria
- Implement build validation testing
- Cover regular and error conditions
- Validate cross-platform build functionality
- Test build performance regression

**Essential testing questions:**
- "What build time targets must be met?"
- "Which bundle size constraints are critical?"
- "What platforms need build support?"
- "What caching effectiveness is expected?"

### Minimal Intervention Principle

**Surgical precision:**
- Change only what's necessary for build requirements
- Preserve existing build functionality
- Avoid over-engineering build solutions
- Target build bottlenecks, not symptoms
- Minimize disruption to development workflows
- Default to simplest build solution

### Temporary File Management

**Organized temporary files:**
- Prefix with `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for temporary files
- Use `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for long-term temporary files
- Delete temporary files after build task completion
- Never commit temporary files to repository
- Maintain clean workspace

### Decision Boundaries

**Clear escalation points:**
- Never assume build scope without confirmation
- Always ask about performance thresholds
- Confirm caching requirements explicitly
- Clarify bundle size constraints
- Verify deployment target needs
- Escalate build architecture decisions

**Framework compliance verification:**
- [ ] Atomic commits implemented
- [ ] Sequential-thinking utilized
- [ ] Task-master integrated
