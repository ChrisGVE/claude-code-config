## Framework Compliance

### CLAUDE.md Framework Integration

This agent operates under the CLAUDE.md framework requirements for consistent, reliable development practices.

### Atomic Commit Discipline

**Mandatory commit workflow:**
- Commit after every single change (update package → commit, fix vulnerability → commit, add test → commit)
- One logical change = One commit
- Never batch multiple dependency changes
- Test each dependency change before committing
- Use semantic commit messages: `<type>: <description>`

**Commit verification:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5  # Verify granular commits
git status           # Ensure clean state
```

### Sequential-Thinking Integration

**Complex dependency management breakdown:**
- Use `sequential-thinking` tool for multi-step dependency operations
- Break down complex dependency trees systematically
- Plan security update phases with clear reasoning
- Document dependency decision thought process for future reference
- Validate dependency changes before execution

### Task-Master Integration

**Comprehensive task management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (no separate todo lists)
- Generate tasks from PRD using `parse-prd`
- Expand tasks with `expand_task` before execution
- Update status with `set_task_status`
- Track dependency management progress systematically

**Essential commands:**
- `get_tasks` - View current dependency tasks
- `add_task` - Add new dependency management tasks
- `expand_task` - Break down complex dependency operations
- `set_task_status` - Update dependency progress

### Git Discipline

**Strict commit conventions:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

fix: update lodash to fix security vulnerability
feat: add webpack bundle analyzer
chore: update dev dependencies to latest
test: add dependency audit tests
```

**Repository cleanliness:**
- Include only source code, tests, and public documentation
- Use `.gitignore` for temporary files, research, and strategy docs
- Follow selective staging (not `git add .`)
- Push after 5-10 commits or key fixes

### Assumption Verification

**Critical verification process:**
- State assumptions explicitly before acting
- Ask "Is this assumption correct?" for any uncertainty
- Never assume scope, test coverage, or performance requirements
- Confirm dependency management decisions with stakeholders
- Document verified assumptions

**Common dependency assumptions to verify:**
- Security tolerance levels
- Update frequency preferences
- Breaking change acceptance
- Bundle size constraints
- Performance impact requirements

### Context7 Usage

**Automatic library integration:**
- Use Context7 MCP tools for library documentation
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs`
- Integrate library knowledge into dependency decisions
- Stay current with library API changes and security updates
- Leverage official documentation for accurate dependency management

### Test Specification Requirements

**Comprehensive testing approach:**
- Ask users for specific dependency test requirements
- Define security vulnerability testing criteria
- Implement dependency validation testing
- Cover regular and edge case dependency scenarios
- Validate cross-package compatibility
- Test performance impact of dependency changes

**Essential testing questions:**
- "What security standards must be met?"
- "Which compatibility requirements are critical?"
- "What performance impact is acceptable?"
- "What update frequency is preferred?"

### Minimal Intervention Principle

**Surgical precision:**
- Change only what's necessary for dependency requirements
- Preserve existing functionality completely
- Avoid over-engineering dependency solutions
- Target security vulnerabilities, not symptoms
- Minimize disruption to existing workflows
- Default to most stable dependency versions

### Temporary File Management

**Organized temporary files:**
- Prefix with `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for temporary files
- Use `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for long-term temporary files
- Delete temporary files after dependency task completion
- Never commit temporary files to repository
- Maintain clean workspace

### Decision Boundaries

**Clear escalation points:**
- Never assume dependency scope without confirmation
- Always ask about security tolerance levels
- Confirm breaking change acceptance explicitly
- Clarify bundle size constraints
- Verify update frequency preferences
- Escalate major version update decisions

**Framework compliance verification:**
- [ ] Atomic commits implemented
- [ ] Sequential-thinking utilized
- [ ] Task-master integrated
- [ ] Git discipline followed
- [ ] Assumptions verified
- [ ] Context7 utilized
- [ ] Tests specified
- [ ] Changes minimal
