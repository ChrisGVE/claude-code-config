## Framework Compliance

### CLAUDE.md Framework Integration

This agent operates under the CLAUDE.md framework requirements for consistent, reliable development practices.

### Atomic Commit Discipline

**Mandatory commit workflow:**
- Commit after every single change (add function → commit, modify logic → commit, add test → commit)
- One logical change = One commit
- Never batch multiple changes
- Test each change before committing
- Use semantic commit messages: `<type>: <description>`

**Commit verification:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5  # Verify granular commits
git status           # Ensure clean state
```

### Sequential-Thinking Integration

**Complex task breakdown:**
- Use `sequential-thinking` tool for multi-step operations
- Break down tooling architecture decisions systematically
- Plan implementation phases with clear reasoning
- Document thought process for future reference
- Validate approach before execution

### Task-Master Integration

**Comprehensive task management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (no separate todo lists)
- Generate tasks from PRD using `parse-prd`
- Expand tasks with `expand_task` before execution
- Update status with `set_task_status`
- Track development progress systematically

**Essential commands:**
- `get_tasks` - View current tasks
- `add_task` - Add new development tasks
- `expand_task` - Break down complex tooling tasks
- `set_task_status` - Update progress

### Git Discipline

**Strict commit conventions:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

feat: add CLI completion system
fix: resolve plugin loading issue
test: add integration tests for CLI
docs: update tool configuration guide
```

**Repository cleanliness:**
- Include only source code, tests, and public documentation
- Use `.gitignore` for temporary files, research, and strategy docs
- Follow selective staging (not `git add .`)
- Push after 5-10 commits or key fixes

### Assumption Verification

**Critical verification process:**
- State assumptions explicitly before acting
- Ask "Is this assumption correct?" for any uncertainty
- Never assume scope, test coverage, or performance requirements
- Confirm tool architecture decisions with stakeholders
- Document verified assumptions

**Common tooling assumptions to verify:**
- Performance requirements for tools
- Platform support expectations
- Integration compatibility needs
- User workflow preferences
- Distribution methods

### Context7 Usage

**Automatic library integration:**
- Use Context7 MCP tools for library documentation
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs`
- Integrate library knowledge into tool development
- Stay current with API changes and best practices
- Leverage official documentation for accurate implementation

### Test Specification Requirements

**Comprehensive testing approach:**
- Ask users for specific test requirements
- Define edge cases and performance criteria
- Implement test-driven development
- Cover regular and error conditions
- Validate cross-platform functionality
- Test tool performance benchmarks

**Essential testing questions:**
- "What specific aspects should be tested?"
- "Which edge cases are critical?"
- "What performance criteria must be met?"
- "What platforms need support?"

### Minimal Intervention Principle

**Surgical precision:**
- Change only what's necessary for requirements
- Preserve existing tool functionality
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Target root causes, not symptoms
- Minimize disruption to workflows
- Default to simplest solution

### Temporary File Management

**Organized temporary files:**
- Prefix with `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for temporary files
- Use `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>` for long-term temporary files
- Delete temporary files after task completion
- Never commit temporary files to repository
- Maintain clean workspace

### Decision Boundaries

**Clear escalation points:**
- Never assume tool scope without confirmation
- Always ask about performance thresholds
- Confirm testing requirements explicitly
- Clarify platform support needs
- Verify distribution preferences
- Escalate architectural decisions

**Framework compliance verification:**
- [ ] Atomic commits implemented
- [ ] Sequential-thinking utilized
- [ ] Task-master integrated
- [ ] Git discipline followed
- [ ] Assumptions verified
- [ ] Context7 utilized
- [ ] Tests specified
- [ ] Changes minimal
