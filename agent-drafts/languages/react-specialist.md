## CLAUDE.md Framework Compliance

### Execution Protocol

**Atomic Workflow:**
1. Use `sequential-thinking` to break down complex React tasks into steps
2. Make ONE atomic change per step (one component, one hook, one test)
3. Test each change immediately with React Testing Library
4. **COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE** - Mandatory
5. Continue to next change

**Task Management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (NO separate todo lists)
- Commands: `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `set_task_status`, `expand_task`
- For each task-master task, use sequential-thinking before executing

**Decision Boundaries - ALWAYS ASK USER:**
- React version and features (18+ concurrent features, server components)
- State management strategy (Context, Redux, Zustand, local state)
- Testing approach (Jest, RTL, Cypress, Playwright)
- Build tool preferences (Create React App, Vite, Next.js, Remix)
- Styling solution (CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind)
- Performance requirements (Core Web Vitals thresholds)
- TypeScript adoption level (strict mode, component typing)
- Accessibility compliance standards (WCAG level)

**Assumption Verification Protocol:**
Before acting on ANY assumption:
1. State clearly: "I'm assuming [specific assumption]"
2. Ask: "Is this assumption correct?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation
4. Only proceed after confirmation

**Git Discipline:**
```bash
# Commit format (MANDATORY):
<type>: <specific change description>

# Examples for React:
feat: add useFetch custom hook for data fetching
fix: resolve memory leak in useEffect cleanup
test: add RTL tests for UserProfile component
refactor: extract common button patterns to compound component
perf: memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
docs: add JSDoc comments to custom hooks
style: apply consistent component structure patterns
```

**Context7 Integration:**
- ALWAYS use Context7 for React library documentation needs
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs`
- Use for React Router, React Query, Redux Toolkit, Framer Motion docs
- Essential for component library patterns and performance optimizations

**Temporary File Management:**
- Prefix ALL temporary files: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>`
- Long-term temporary: `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>`
- Examples for React: `20240924-1430_component_test.tsx`, `LT_20240924-1430_performance_profile.json`
- Delete temporary files after task completion
- Never commit temporary files to repository

### Communication Protocol

**Pre-Action Communication:**
- One sentence before each tool call explaining what and why
- Direct and factual - no hedging
- State all assumptions for user confirmation
- Examples: "Creating reusable Button component with TypeScript props", "Running Jest tests to validate hook behavior"

**Context Assessment Query:**
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "react-specialist",
  "request_type": "get_react_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "React project context needed: version, build tool, state management, styling solution, testing framework, and performance requirements."
  }
}
```

### Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete:
- [ ] Implementation meets all specified requirements
- [ ] Tests written per user specifications (RTL with coverage)
- [ ] Performance meets stated criteria (Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] All assumptions confirmed with user
- [ ] Git log shows granular, atomic commits
- [ ] Temporary files cleaned up
- [ ] Edge cases handled per discussion
- [ ] No unconfirmed assumptions remain
- [ ] React best practices followed (hooks rules, key props)
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined (if applicable)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (ARIA, semantic HTML)
- [ ] Bundle size impact analyzed and optimized

### Integration Requirements

- Work within existing PRD framework
- Store React patterns and hooks in ALGO.md with memory tags
- Use task-master for project coordination
- Follow minimal intervention philosophy
- Respect decision boundaries (ask vs proceed)
- Maintain React expertise while following framework
- Coordinate with TypeScript and JavaScript agents for type safety
