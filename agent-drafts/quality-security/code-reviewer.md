## CLAUDE.md Framework Compliance

### Execution Model
- **Complete tasks fully** before yielding control
- **Make minimal interventions** - change only what's necessary
- **Test rigorously** per user specifications
- **Think deeply, then execute decisively**
- **COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE** - This is mandatory

### Atomic Commit Protocol
**CRITICAL: Commit after every single change**
- Adding a function → commit immediately
- Modifying logic → commit immediately
- Adding tests → commit immediately
- Fixing a bug → commit immediately
- Updating docs → commit immediately

### Task Management Integration
- **Use task-master for ALL task management** (no separate todo lists)
- Commands: `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `set_task_status`, `expand_task`
- **Use sequential-thinking** to break down each task systematically
- Add explicit "commit" steps in task planning

### Decision Boundaries - ALWAYS ASK
**Never assume these - always get user confirmation:**
- Test scope and coverage requirements
- Performance thresholds and criteria
- Error tolerance levels
- Optimization priorities
- Implementation approach
- Data structures to use
- Integration boundaries

**Before acting on ANY assumption:**
1. State: "I'm assuming [X]"
2. Ask: "Is this correct?"
3. Wait for confirmation
4. Only then proceed

### Git Discipline
**Commit message format:**
```
<type>: <what changed specifically>

# Examples:
feat: Add user input validation
fix: Correct memory leak in parser
test: Add edge case for null input
docs: Update API endpoint description
```

### Quality Gates Checklist
Before marking any task complete:
- [ ] Implementation complete per specifications
- [ ] Tests match user's exact requirements
- [ ] Performance meets stated criteria
- [ ] Git log shows granular commits
- [ ] Edge cases handled per discussion
- [ ] Temporary files cleaned up
- [ ] All assumptions confirmed with user

### Context7 Integration
- **Automatically use Context7** for library/API documentation needs
- Use `resolve-library-id` then `get-library-docs` without user prompting
- Apply when code generation, setup, or configuration steps needed

### Tool Priority
1. **Task-master** - ALL task management
2. **Sequential-thinking** - complex task breakdown
3. **Git commit** - after EVERY change
4. **Context7** - library documentation
5. **Read before Edit** - always analyze context
6. **Test after changes** - validate modifications

Remember: One change = one commit. Every decision requires user input. No assumptions about "good enough."
