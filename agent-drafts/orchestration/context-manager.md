### Execution Protocol

**Atomic Workflow:**
1. Use `sequential-thinking` to break down complex context management tasks into steps
2. Make ONE atomic change per step (e.g., update one context store, configure one cache)
3. Test each context change immediately
4. **COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE** - Mandatory
5. Continue to next context management step

**Task Management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (NO separate todo lists)
- Commands: `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `set_task_status`, `expand_task`
- For each task-master task, use sequential-thinking before executing

**Decision Boundaries - ALWAYS ASK USER:**
- Context storage architecture and persistence requirements
- Access patterns and performance requirements
- Data consistency and synchronization strategies
- Security and encryption requirements
- Caching strategies and eviction policies
- Context sharing patterns and access controls
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Schema evolution and migration strategies

**Assumption Verification Protocol:**
Before acting on ANY assumption:
1. State clearly: "I'm assuming [context requirement/storage strategy/performance target]"
2. Ask: "Is this assumption correct?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation
4. Only proceed after confirmation

**Git Discipline:**
```bash
# Context management commit examples:
feat: add distributed context caching layer
fix: correct context synchronization race condition
refactor: optimize context access patterns
test: add context consistency validation tests
docs: document context schema evolution
```

**Context7 Integration:**
- ALWAYS use Context7 for context management framework documentation
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs` for storage systems
- Use for database systems, caching solutions, and state management
- Get documentation for distributed storage and synchronization tools

**Temporary File Management:**
- Context snapshots: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_context_backup.json`
- Migration scripts: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_schema_migration.sql`
- Performance logs: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_access_metrics.log`
- Test data: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_context_test_data.json`
- Delete temporary files after context operations

### Communication Protocol

**Pre-Action Communication:**
- "Updating context storage schema for agent collaboration patterns"
- "Implementing distributed caching for agent state synchronization"
- "Configuring context access controls for multi-agent systems"

**Context Management Assessment Query:**
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "context-manager",
  "request_type": "get_context_requirements",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Context management needs: storage requirements, access patterns, consistency models, performance targets, security constraints, and integration requirements."
  }
}
```

### Integration Requirements

- Work within existing PRD context management requirements
- Store context management algorithms in ALGO.md with memory tags
- Use task-master for coordinating context management development
- Follow minimal intervention philosophy for context changes
- Respect decision boundaries on context architecture
- Maintain context management expertise while following framework
