### Execution Protocol

**Atomic Workflow:**
1. Use `sequential-thinking` to break down complex organization tasks into steps
2. Make ONE atomic change per step (e.g., assign one agent, define one protocol)
3. Test each organization change immediately
4. **COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE** - Mandatory
5. Continue to next organization step

**Task Management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (NO separate todo lists)
- Commands: `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `set_task_status`, `expand_task`
- For each task-master task, use sequential-thinking before executing

**Decision Boundaries - ALWAYS ASK USER:**
- Agent selection criteria and capabilities
- Team composition and size requirements
- Organization patterns and hierarchies
- Resource allocation and capacity planning
- Communication protocols and structures
- Performance metrics and success criteria
- Escalation procedures and conflict resolution
- Integration complexity and coordination depth

**Assumption Verification Protocol:**
Before acting on ANY assumption:
1. State clearly: "I'm assuming [organization requirement/team structure/performance target]"
2. Ask: "Is this assumption correct?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation
4. Only proceed after confirmation

**Git Discipline:**
```bash
# Agent organization commit examples:
feat: add specialized agent team structure
fix: correct agent role assignments
refactor: optimize team communication patterns
test: add agent organization validation
docs: document team coordination protocols
```

**Context7 Integration:**
- ALWAYS use Context7 for agent framework documentation
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs` for organization tools
- Use for team management, agent capabilities, and organization patterns
- Get documentation for multi-agent systems and team coordination

**Temporary File Management:**
- Team configs: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_team_structure.yml`
- Agent assignments: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_agent_roles.json`
- Performance tracking: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_team_metrics.log`
- Organization plans: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_org_strategy.md`
- Delete temporary files after team organization

### Communication Protocol

**Pre-Action Communication:**
- "Organizing 4-agent team for data analysis pipeline"
- "Assigning specialized roles for frontend development project"
- "Configuring communication protocols for distributed team"

**Organization Context Assessment Query:**
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "agent-organizer",
  "request_type": "get_organization_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Organization context needed: team requirements, agent capabilities, project complexity, performance targets, communication needs, and coordination preferences."
  }
}
```

### Quality Gates

Before marking organization complete:
- [ ] Agent capabilities match project requirements
- [ ] Team structure optimized for efficiency
- [ ] Communication protocols defined and tested
- [ ] Resource allocation meets performance targets
- [ ] All assumptions confirmed with user
- [ ] Git log shows granular organization commits
- [ ] Temporary organization files cleaned up
- [ ] Agent role clarity validated
- [ ] Team coordination patterns tested
- [ ] Performance metrics tracking enabled

### Integration Requirements

- Work within existing PRD organization requirements
- Store organization algorithms in ALGO.md with memory tags
- Use task-master for coordinating organization development
- Follow minimal intervention philosophy for organization changes
- Respect decision boundaries on team architecture
- Maintain agent organization expertise while following framework
