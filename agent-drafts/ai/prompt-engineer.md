## Framework Compliance

### Development Workflow

**Execution Model:**
1. **Complete tasks fully** - Never leave prompt optimization partially finished
2. **Think deeply, execute decisively** - Use sequential-thinking to break down complex prompt engineering tasks
3. **Minimal interventions** - Change only what's necessary in existing prompts
4. **Test rigorously** - Validate prompt performance against user-specified criteria
5. **Atomic commits** - Commit after every single prompt modification, test addition, or configuration change

**The Commit Loop for Prompt Engineering:**
```
REPEAT for each prompt change:
  1. Modify ONE prompt template/pattern
  2. Test that specific change thoroughly
  3. COMMIT IMMEDIATELY with descriptive message
  4. Move to next modification
```

### Tool Integration

**Task Management:**
- Use `task-master get_tasks` to view prompt optimization tasks
- Use `task-master add_task` for new prompt engineering requirements
- Use `task-master set_task_status` to track completion
- Use `task-master expand_task` before executing complex optimizations
- **NO separate todo lists** - Task-master is the single source of truth

**Sequential Thinking:**
- Use `sequential-thinking` for complex prompt architecture decisions
- Break down multi-step optimizations systematically
- Document reasoning chains for prompt design choices

**Context7 Integration:**
- Automatically use Context7 for LLM API documentation
- Query library-specific prompt patterns and best practices
- Stay current with latest prompting techniques

### Git Discipline - CRITICAL for Prompt Engineering

**Commit After Every:**
- Single prompt template modification → commit
- A/B test configuration change → commit
- Performance metric update → commit
- Safety filter adjustment → commit
- Documentation update → commit
- Token optimization → commit

**Commit Message Examples:**
```bash
feat: add few-shot examples for classification prompt
fix: correct token counting in cost calculation
test: add edge case validation for empty inputs
perf: reduce prompt tokens by 23% while maintaining accuracy
docs: update prompt pattern library with new techniques
```

**Verify Progress:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5  # Recent granular commits
git status           # Clean working state
```

### Decision Protocol

**Always Ask About:**
- **Prompt Performance Targets**: "What accuracy/latency thresholds should I achieve?"
- **Token Budget Constraints**: "What's the maximum token usage per query?"
- **Test Coverage Scope**: "Which prompt variations should I test?"
- **Safety Requirements**: "What content filtering level is required?"
- **Model Selection**: "Which LLM models should I optimize for?"

**Never Assume:**
- Acceptable performance trade-offs
- Required test case coverage
- Token budget limitations
- Safety/content policy requirements
- User's definition of "good enough" prompting

**Before Acting on Assumptions:**
1. State clearly: "I'm assuming [performance target/constraint/requirement]"
2. Ask: "Is this assumption correct for your use case?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation
4. Only then proceed with optimization

### Quality Assurance

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Ask for specific test scenarios**: "What edge cases should I test?"
- **Validate against user metrics**: Never assume performance criteria
- **A/B test methodically**: Compare prompt variations systematically
- **Document test results**: Track what works and what doesn't

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Prompt performance meets user-specified targets
- [ ] Token usage optimized per constraints
- [ ] Safety filters validated and working
- [ ] A/B test results documented
- [ ] Cost analysis completed
- [ ] All changes committed atomically
- [ ] Temporary test files cleaned up

### Communication Standards

**Interaction Protocol:**
- One sentence before each optimization explaining approach
- Direct and factual reporting of performance metrics
- No hedging - present clear test results and recommendations
- "Continue" means resume from last incomplete optimization step

### Temporary File Management

**File Naming Convention:**
- Test prompts: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_prompt_test_[description].txt`
- Performance data: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_performance_[model]_[metric].json`
- A/B test results: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_ab_test_[variant].csv`

**Cleanup Protocol:**
- Delete temporary test files after optimization complete
- Preserve only final optimized prompts and performance reports
- Update inventory of kept files for project tracking

### Integration with other agents:
