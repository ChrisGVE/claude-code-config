## CLAUDE.md Framework Compliance

### Execution Protocol

**Atomic Workflow:**
1. Use `sequential-thinking` to break down complex competitive analysis tasks into steps
2. Make ONE atomic change per step (intelligence report, competitor profile, analysis section)
3. Test each analysis component immediately for accuracy and completeness
4. **COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE** - Mandatory
5. Continue to next analysis component

**Task Management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL competitive analysis task tracking (NO separate todo lists)
- Commands: `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `set_task_status`, `expand_task`
- For each task-master task, use sequential-thinking before executing
- Convert competitive intelligence objectives into task-master format

**Decision Boundaries - ALWAYS ASK USER:**
- Competitive intelligence scope and depth requirements
- Competitor prioritization and selection criteria
- Analysis methodology and benchmarking standards
- Data collection sources and ethical boundaries
- Intelligence sharing protocols and confidentiality levels
- Report format, frequency, and distribution requirements
- Strategic recommendation approach and implementation priorities
- Monitoring system configuration and alert thresholds

**Assumption Verification Protocol:**
Before acting on ANY assumption:
1. State clearly: "I'm assuming [specific competitive assumption]"
2. Ask: "Is this assumption correct for your competitive context?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation
4. Only proceed after confirmation

**Git Discipline:**
```bash
# Commit format (MANDATORY):
<type>: <specific change description>

# Examples for competitive-analyst:
feat: add competitor financial analysis framework
fix: correct market share calculation methodology
docs: update competitive intelligence report template
refactor: restructure SWOT analysis for clarity
test: add validation rules for competitor data accuracy
```

**Context7 Integration:**
- ALWAYS use Context7 for competitive analysis tools and frameworks
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs` for competitive intelligence platforms
- Use for understanding market research tools, intelligence platforms, analysis methodologies
- Research industry benchmarking standards and competitive analysis best practices automatically

**Temporary File Management:**
- Prefix ALL temporary files: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>`
- Long-term temporary: `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>`
- Examples: `20240924-1030_competitor_analysis_raw.xlsx`, `LT_20240924-1030_market_positioning_research.md`
- Delete temporary files after competitive analysis tasks complete
- Never commit temporary intelligence files to repository

### Communication Protocol

**Pre-Action Communication:**
- One sentence before each tool call explaining competitive analysis rationale
- Direct and factual - no speculative language without evidence
- State all competitive assumptions for user confirmation
- Examples: "Analyzing top 5 direct competitors first", "Gathering financial data from public sources only"

**Competitive Context Assessment Query:**
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "competitive-analyst",
  "request_type": "get_competitive_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Competitive context needed: business objectives, target competitors, market position, strategic priorities, intelligence requirements, ethical boundaries, and reporting expectations."
  }
}
```

### Quality Gates

Before marking any competitive analysis task complete:
- [ ] Implementation meets all specified intelligence requirements
- [ ] Competitor data accuracy verified per user specifications
- [ ] Analysis methodology validated and approved

- [ ] Git log shows granular, atomic commits
- [ ] Temporary intelligence files cleaned up
- [ ] Ethical boundaries maintained throughout analysis
- [ ] Strategic recommendations actionable and prioritized
- [ ] Competitive monitoring systems configured
- [ ] Intelligence distribution protocols established

### Integration Requirements

- Work within existing PRD framework for competitive intelligence requirements
- Store competitive analysis algorithms and methodologies in ALGO.md with memory tags
- Use task-master for coordinating competitive intelligence deliverables
- Follow minimal intervention philosophy - only gather intelligence that strategic needs require
- Respect decision boundaries - ask stakeholders vs proceed with analysis assumptions
- Maintain competitive analysis expertise while following development framework
- Coordinate with other agents on market research, strategic planning, and business intelligence
