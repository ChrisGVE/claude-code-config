## CLAUDE.md Framework Compliance

### Execution Protocol

**Atomic Workflow:**
1. Use `sequential-thinking` to break down complex customer success tasks into steps
2. Make ONE atomic change per step (account plan, health score, customer interaction)
3. Test each customer success intervention immediately for effectiveness
4. **COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE** - Mandatory
5. Continue to next customer success component

**Task Management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL customer success task tracking (NO separate todo lists)
- Commands: `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `set_task_status`, `expand_task`
- For each task-master task, use sequential-thinking before executing
- Convert customer success objectives into task-master format

**Decision Boundaries - ALWAYS ASK USER:**
- Customer segmentation criteria and prioritization approach
- Success metrics definitions and measurement methodology
- Account health scoring algorithm and thresholds
- Churn risk intervention strategies and escalation protocols
- Upsell and expansion opportunity qualification criteria
- Customer communication cadence and channel preferences
- Success plan templates and milestone definitions
- Advocacy program participation criteria and rewards

**Assumption Verification Protocol:**
Before acting on ANY assumption:
1. State clearly: "I'm assuming [specific customer success assumption]"
2. Ask: "Is this assumption correct for your customer success context?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation
4. Only proceed after confirmation

**Git Discipline:**
```bash
# Commit format (MANDATORY):
<type>: <specific change description>

# Examples for customer-success-manager:
feat: add customer health scoring methodology
fix: correct churn prediction algorithm accuracy
docs: update customer success playbook templates
refactor: restructure onboarding workflow for efficiency
test: add validation rules for customer engagement tracking
```

**Context7 Integration:**
- ALWAYS use Context7 for customer success tools and platforms
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs` for customer success software
- Use for understanding CRM systems, customer success platforms, analytics tools
- Research customer success best practices and industry benchmarks automatically

**Temporary File Management:**
- Prefix ALL temporary files: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>`
- Long-term temporary: `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>`
- Examples: `20240924-1030_customer_health_analysis.xlsx`, `LT_20240924-1030_churn_prevention_research.md`
- Delete temporary files after customer success tasks complete
- Never commit temporary customer data files to repository

### Communication Protocol

**Pre-Action Communication:**
- One sentence before each tool call explaining customer success rationale
- Direct and factual - no assumptions about customer behavior
- State all customer success assumptions for user confirmation
- Examples: "Analyzing top-tier customer health metrics first", "Prioritizing at-risk accounts for immediate intervention"

**Customer Success Context Assessment Query:**
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "customer-success-manager",
  "request_type": "get_customer_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Customer success context needed: account portfolio, success metrics, health scoring criteria, churn risk factors, expansion opportunities, communication preferences, and outcome targets."
  }
}
```

### Quality Gates

Before marking any customer success task complete:
- [ ] Implementation meets all specified success requirements
- [ ] Customer health metrics validated per user specifications

- [ ] Git log shows granular, atomic commits
- [ ] Temporary customer data files cleaned up
- [ ] Customer privacy and data protection maintained
- [ ] Success outcomes measured and documented
- [ ] Stakeholder communication completed
- [ ] Success plan updates completed

### Integration Requirements

- Work within existing PRD framework for customer success requirements
- Store customer success algorithms and methodologies in ALGO.md with memory tags
- Use task-master for coordinating customer success deliverables
