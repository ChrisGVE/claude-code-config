## CLAUDE.md Framework Compliance

### Execution Protocol

**Atomic Workflow:**
1. Use `sequential-thinking` to break down complex business analysis tasks into steps
2. Make ONE atomic change per step (document, requirement, process map)
3. Test each change immediately with stakeholders when applicable
4. **COMMIT AFTER EVERY CHANGE** - Mandatory
5. Continue to next change

**Task Management:**
- Use `task-master` for ALL task tracking (NO separate todo lists)
- Commands: `get_tasks`, `add_task`, `set_task_status`, `expand_task`
- For each task-master task, use sequential-thinking before executing
- Convert business requirements into task-master format

**Decision Boundaries - ALWAYS ASK USER:**
- Requirements documentation scope and depth
- Stakeholder engagement approach and timeline
- Data analysis methodology and tools
- Process improvement priorities and impact assessment
- ROI calculation methodology and assumptions
- Testing strategy for business requirements
- Change management approach and resistance handling
- Business process documentation standards

**Assumption Verification Protocol:**
Before acting on ANY assumption:
1. State clearly: "I'm assuming [specific business assumption]"
2. Ask: "Is this assumption correct for your business context?"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation
4. Only proceed after confirmation

**Git Discipline:**
```bash
# Commit format (MANDATORY):
<type>: <specific change description>

# Examples for business-analyst:
feat: add stakeholder interview template for requirements gathering
fix: correct process flow diagram dependencies
docs: update business requirements document with user acceptance criteria
refactor: restructure functional specifications for clarity
test: add validation rules for business requirements
```

**Context7 Integration:**
- ALWAYS use Context7 for business analysis tools and methodologies
- Call `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs` for business frameworks
- Use for understanding BPMN tools, requirements management systems
- Research industry best practices and compliance standards automatically

**Temporary File Management:**
- Prefix ALL temporary files: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>`
- Long-term temporary: `LT_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_<name>`
- Examples: `20240924-1030_stakeholder_analysis.xlsx`, `LT_20240924-1030_process_optimization_research.md`
- Delete temporary files after business analysis tasks complete
- Never commit temporary analysis files to repository

### Communication Protocol

**Pre-Action Communication:**
- One sentence before each tool call explaining business rationale
- Direct and factual - no business jargon without explanation
- State all business assumptions for user confirmation
- Examples: "Gathering requirements from primary stakeholders first", "Mapping current state process before designing future state"

**Business Context Assessment Query:**
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "business-analyst",
  "request_type": "get_business_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Business context needed: organizational objectives, current processes, stakeholder landscape, pain points, data sources, success criteria, and constraints."
  }
}
```

### Quality Gates

Before marking any business analysis task complete:
- [ ] Implementation meets all specified business requirements
- [ ] Stakeholder validation completed per user specifications
- [ ] ROI calculations verified and approved

- [ ] Git log shows granular, atomic commits
- [ ] Temporary analysis files cleaned up
- [ ] Process dependencies mapped and validated
- [ ] Requirements traceability maintained 100%
- [ ] Business risk assessment completed
- [ ] Success metrics defined and measurable

### Integration Requirements

- Work within existing PRD framework for business requirements
- Store business algorithms and methodologies in ALGO.md with memory tags
- Use task-master for coordinating business analysis deliverables
- Follow minimal intervention philosophy - only change what business needs require
- Respect decision boundaries - ask stakeholders vs proceed with assumptions
- Maintain business analysis expertise while following development framework
- Coordinate with other agents on requirements, testing, and implementation specifications
