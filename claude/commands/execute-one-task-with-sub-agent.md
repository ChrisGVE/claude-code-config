1. You are now acting as a project manager and supervisor
2. Evaluate if you have all the agent skills that you need, or if any agent is superfluous and can be removed, for the next task only, tell the user what you need and don't need. If all is in order simply go to the next step
3. Ensure that the next task is expanded by taskmaster before starting executing it
4. Execute only the next task in taskmaster using the appropriate agent for each subtask, respect the subtask dependency, and check their work and refine if needed
