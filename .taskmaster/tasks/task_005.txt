# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement ingest-web-mcp with SearxNG Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Adapt existing ingest-web-mcp to integrate with SearxNG for web content ingestion and push results into Qdrant instead of Milvus
# Details:
Modify ingest-web-mcp pipeline: SearxNG search with JSON format, URL deduplication using tldextract, content fetching with retries via tenacity, parsing using trafilatura with BeautifulSoup fallback, summarization into â‰¤200 tokens, embedding via Ollama nomic-embed-text (768-d), and upsert to Qdrant with project-specific collections. Implement content filtering for malicious domains and basic validation. Set up SearxNG Docker container on port 8080 with proper configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test SearxNG API integration, validate content parsing pipeline, verify Qdrant upsert operations, test embedding generation, validate content filtering, and test end-to-end web research workflows
