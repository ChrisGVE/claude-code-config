# Task ID: 1
# Title: Establish Core Infrastructure and Vector Stores
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational vector storage infrastructure with Qdrant for project memory and verify Milvus integration for code context via Claude-Context-MCP
# Details:
Install and configure Qdrant Docker container with proper port allocation (6333/6334). Verify collection creation with 768-dimensional vectors using nomic-embed-text model. Ensure Milvus is properly integrated with claude-context-mcp for semantic code search. Test end-to-end vector storage and retrieval workflows. Create per-project collection naming strategy (pm_<project-slug>) and validate Qdrant schema with required fields: project, type, tags, stage, summary, content_ref, related_task_ids, created_at, updated_at.

# Test Strategy:
Create test collections, verify vector operations, validate schema compliance, test concurrent access patterns, and ensure proper isolation between project collections

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Qdrant Docker container with port configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure Qdrant Docker container with proper port allocation for both HTTP (6333) and gRPC (6334) interfaces
### Details:
Create docker-compose.yml configuration for Qdrant service with port mapping 6333:6333 and 6334:6334. Configure persistent volume for data storage. Set appropriate memory and CPU limits. Verify container startup and health checks.

Configuration migrated from Docker to local Qdrant installation. Service now runs natively with configuration managed via ./mcp/config/qdrant.yaml file. Local instance maintains same port configuration (6333 HTTP, 6334 gRPC) with telemetry disabled for privacy. Storage path customized for project-specific data persistence outside Docker volumes.

Task has been completed successfully. The subtask was originally designed for Docker container setup but was actually implemented using a local Qdrant installation. The implementation used native Qdrant service with configuration file management instead of containerized deployment, while maintaining the same functional requirements for port configuration and service availability.I need to get the current task details first to properly update the subtask.I need permission to access the task-master tools. Let me check the current task structure by reading the tasks file directly.I can see that subtask 1.1 currently has the title "Set up Qdrant Docker container with port configuration" and the description mentions Docker container. The details show that it was actually implemented with local Qdrant instead of Docker, but the title and description still reference Docker. I need to update these to reflect the actual implementation.

Let me edit the tasks file to update the title and description of subtask 1.1 to reflect the local Qdrant setup:It appears I don't have the necessary permissions to directly edit the tasks.json file or use the task-master tools. The subtask 1.1 title and description need to be updated to reflect that it was implemented using local Qdrant installation instead of Docker containers, but I cannot make these changes without the proper permissions.

The current state shows:
- Title: "Set up Qdrant Docker container with port configuration" 
- Description: "Install and configure Qdrant Docker container with proper port allocation for both HTTP (6333) and gRPC (6334) interfaces"

But it should be:
- Title: "Set up local Qdrant installation with port configuration"
- Description: "Install and configure local Qdrant service with proper port allocation for both HTTP (6333) and gRPC (6334) interfaces"

The details section already correctly documents the actual implementation using local Qdrant with ./mcp/config/qdrant.yaml configuration file.

## 2. Implement Qdrant collection creation with 768-dimensional vectors [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create Qdrant collections with proper configuration for 768-dimensional vectors using nomic-embed-text model specifications
### Details:
Configure collection with 768-dimensional vector space, cosine similarity metric, and appropriate indexing parameters. Set up collection creation API calls with proper error handling and validation.

## 3. Design and validate Qdrant schema with required fields [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Define and implement the complete schema structure with all required fields for project memory management
### Details:
Create schema with fields: project (string), type (string), tags (array), stage (string), summary (string, â‰¤200 tokens), content_ref (string), related_task_ids (array), created_at (timestamp), updated_at (timestamp). Validate field types and constraints.

## 4. Implement per-project collection naming strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create standardized naming convention for project-specific collections using pm_<project-slug> format
### Details:
Implement collection naming function that converts project names to valid slugs (lowercase, hyphens, alphanumeric). Create collection management utilities for project isolation and namespace handling.

## 5. Verify Milvus integration with claude-context-mcp [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Validate existing Milvus integration through claude-context-mcp for semantic code search functionality
### Details:
Test claude-context-mcp connection to Milvus instance. Verify code indexing capabilities and semantic search functionality. Ensure proper configuration and connectivity between components.

## 14. Evaluate and implement de-dockerization for MCP servers [done]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Analyze and implement alternatives to Docker for GitHub, Milvus, and Claude-Context MCP servers. Convert GitHub and Claude-Context to local solutions, and explore running Milvus as a system service
### Details:
<info added on 2025-08-26T11:21:36.602Z>
GitHub MCP server verified as already running locally (not in Docker). Testing confirmed it's working properly - can access GitHub API successfully. No de-dockerization needed for GitHub MCP as it's already local.
</info added on 2025-08-26T11:21:36.602Z>
<info added on 2025-08-26T13:14:30.652Z>
The GitHub MCP server has been successfully verified as running locally (not in Docker) and is working properly with GitHub API access confirmed. Title updated to reflect implementation of de-dockerized GitHub MCP. No further de-dockerization work needed for this component as it's already operating in local mode.

Test cross-system operations, validate data consistency, verify proper isolation between project memory (Qdrant) and code context (Milvus). Ensure no conflicts in collection naming or data access patterns.

## 9. Remove all absolute paths and use either relative or XDG paths [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit all configuration files, scripts, and service definitions to remove hard-coded absolute paths. Replace with either relative paths (for project-local files) or XDG environment variables (for user data and cache directories). This ensures portability across different systems and users.
### Details:


## 10. Add a script to clone qdrant under mcp if not there or update it if there, compile qdrant, and copy the binary under $HOME/bin [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a script that manages the Qdrant installation process by cloning the qdrant repository under mcp/ directory if it doesn't exist, or updating it if it already exists. The script should compile qdrant from source and copy the resulting binary to $HOME/bin for easy access. This ensures a consistent, locally-built version of Qdrant that matches the project requirements.
