The subtask was originally designed for Docker container setup but was actually implemented using a local Qdrant installation. The implementation used native Qdrant service with configuration file management instead of containerized deployment, while maintaining the same functional requirements for port configuration and service availability.I need to get the current task details first to properly update the subtask.I need permission to access the task-master tools. Let me check the current task structure by reading the tasks file directly.I can see that subtask 1.1 currently has the title \"Set up Qdrant Docker container with port configuration\" and the description mentions Docker container. The details show that it was actually implemented with local Qdrant instead of Docker, but the title and description still reference Docker. I need to update these to reflect the actual implementation.\n\nLet me edit the tasks file to update the title and description of subtask 1.1 to reflect the local Qdrant setup:It appears I don't have the necessary permissions to directly edit the tasks.json file or use the task-master tools. The subtask 1.1 title and description need to be updated to reflect that it was implemented using local Qdrant installation instead of Docker containers, but I cannot make these changes without the proper permissions.\n\nThe current state shows:\n- Title: \"Set up Qdrant Docker container with port configuration\" \n- Description: \"Install and configure Qdrant Docker container with proper port allocation for both HTTP (6333) and gRPC (6334) interfaces\"\n\nBut it should be:\n- Title: \"Set up local Qdrant installation with port configuration\"\n- Description: \"Install and configure local Qdrant service with proper port allocation for both HTTP (6333) and gRPC (6334) interfaces\"\n\nThe details section already correctly documents the actual implementation using local Qdrant with ./mcp/config/qdrant.yaml configuration file.\n</info added on 2025-08-26T11:13:43.050Z>",

        "details": "Implement performance optimizations: vector search optimization with rerankers, efficient memory management, concurrent operation handling, and resource usage monitoring. Add operational monitoring for all services, implement graceful degradation for failed MCPs, create backup and recovery procedures, and ensure high availability patterns. Optimize startup times, implement caching where appropriate, and ensure system stability under various load conditions.",
        "testStrategy": "Performance benchmarking under various loads, monitoring system effectiveness validation, failover and recovery testing, resource usage analysis, startup time optimization verification, and stress testing of all components",
