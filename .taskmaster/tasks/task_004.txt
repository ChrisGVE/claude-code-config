# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Task-master Integration Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Research and implement integration approaches with Task-master MCP server for seamless task management and capability binding
# Details:
Conduct comprehensive analysis of Task-master architecture and integration options: MCP-to-MCP communication patterns, CLI interface integration, direct JavaScript codebase integration, Python-JavaScript bridge solutions. Implement chosen integration approach with capability requirements binding. Create monitoring system for task-master repository changes and implement CI setup for breaking change detection. Follow canonical task schema without custom fields, using details/testStrategy for cross-references.

# Test Strategy:
Test MCP communication patterns, validate task schema compliance, test capability binding mechanisms, verify repository monitoring, and validate integration stability
