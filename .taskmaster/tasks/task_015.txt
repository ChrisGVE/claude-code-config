# Task ID: 15
# Title: Deep Analysis of Existing Systems for Daemon Design
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive analysis of claude-task-master, claude-context, qdrant-mcp, and serena to extract patterns, technologies, and design decisions for daemon architecture
# Details:
Analyze codebases to extract:
- Chunking strategies and parameters
- File watching patterns and ignore handling  
- LSP integration approaches
- MCP server architectures
- Embedding and search patterns
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Configuration management approaches

Store all findings in Qdrant for reference during implementation planning.

# Test Strategy:
Validate extracted patterns against original codebases. Ensure comprehensive coverage of architectural decisions and implementation choices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze claude-context MCP architecture and patterns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deep dive into claude-context codebase to extract chunking strategies, file handling, Milvus integration patterns, and search implementation
### Details:


## 2. Analyze claude-task-master MCP server implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Study task-master MCP architecture, CLI integration patterns, task management workflows, and FastMCP usage patterns
### Details:


## 3. Analyze official Qdrant MCP server capabilities and limitations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Study qdrant-mcp implementation, single-collection constraints, search patterns, and identify multi-collection requirements
### Details:


## 4. Analyze Serena LSP integration and file watching patterns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Study Serena's LSP usage, symbol extraction, file monitoring approaches, and language-specific handling for integration insights
### Details:


## 5. Synthesize findings and create daemon architecture specification [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Consolidate analysis results into comprehensive architecture specification for the project-code daemon and multi-collection MCP design
