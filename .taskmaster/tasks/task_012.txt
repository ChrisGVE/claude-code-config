# Task ID: 12
# Title: Performance Optimization and Production Readiness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize system performance, implement monitoring, and ensure production readiness with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations: vector search optimization with rerankers, efficient memory management, concurrent operation handling, and resource usage monitoring. Add operational monitoring for all services, implement graceful degradation for failed MCPs, create backup and recovery procedures, and ensure high availability patterns. Optimize startup times, implement caching where appropriate, and ensure system stability under various load conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Performance benchmarking under various loads, monitoring system effectiveness validation, failover and recovery testing, resource usage analysis, startup time optimization verification, and stress testing of all components
