			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Establish Core Infrastructure and Vector Stores",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into specific technical implementation steps: Docker Qdrant setup with port configuration, Qdrant collection creation with 768-dimensional vectors, Milvus integration verification with claude-context-mcp, schema validation with required fields (project, type, tags, stage, summary, content_ref, related_task_ids, created_at, updated_at), per-project collection naming strategy implementation, and end-to-end testing workflows.",
			"reasoning": "Based on codebase analysis, this project already has substantial infrastructure in place including task-master, docker configurations, and MCP integrations. The task requires Docker orchestration, vector database configuration, schema design, and integration testing. While foundational, the existing infrastructure reduces complexity from what would be a 9-10 score."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement claude-capability-manager MCP Server",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Develop this complex MCP server by breaking it into: FastMCP framework integration and setup, dual-mode operation (stdio MCP server + CLI tool) implementation, capability detection logic from PRDs using existing parsing patterns, registry-driven MCP/subagent deployment system, project scaffolding with .claude folder structure creation, template management system for CLAUDE.md variants (bootstrap, step2, production), new project workflow implementation, existing project migration workflow, registry.yaml integration and processing, error handling for failed tool deployments, and comprehensive testing suite.",
			"reasoning": "This is the core orchestration component requiring deep integration with multiple systems. Analysis of existing MCP patterns in the codebase shows substantial complexity in MCP development, registry management, and workflow orchestration. High complexity due to being a foundational system that coordinates all other components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Registry System and Project Bootstrap Workflows",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Design and implement the registry system through: registry.yaml schema design with MCP definitions and subagent mappings, workflow orchestration syntax implementation, file operations system (copy_into_project, move_within_project), directory creation automation, git operations integration, project_registry actions (sync, deploy_agent, deploy_mcp), task-master operations integration, safety checks implementation, 3-step new project workflow (Project Scaffolding Setup, PRD Iterative Refinement, Task-master Initialization), and existing project migration workflows with entry point detection.",
			"reasoning": "The codebase shows extensive template and configuration management systems. This task involves complex workflow orchestration, file system operations, and integration with multiple tools. The existing .claude/ directory structure and configuration patterns provide foundation but the automation layer adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Task-master Integration Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Research and implement task-master integration through: comprehensive Task-master architecture analysis using existing .taskmaster/ directory structure, MCP-to-MCP communication patterns investigation, CLI interface integration implementation leveraging existing task-master commands, direct JavaScript codebase integration exploration, Python-JavaScript bridge solutions development, capability requirements binding system implementation, and CI setup for breaking change detection with repository monitoring system.",
			"reasoning": "Analysis shows Task-master is already well-integrated with extensive .taskmaster/ infrastructure, commands, and existing MCP setup. The research and integration work is more about optimization and enhancement rather than ground-up development, reducing complexity from what would be higher."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ingest-web-mcp with SearxNG Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Modify the existing ingest-web-mcp pipeline by implementing: SearxNG Docker container setup on port 8080, JSON format API integration with SearxNG, URL deduplication system using tldextract, content fetching with retry logic via tenacity, content parsing using trafilatura with BeautifulSoup fallback, text summarization to ≤200 tokens, embedding generation via Ollama nomic-embed-text (768-d), Qdrant upsert operations with project-specific collections, content filtering for malicious domains, and end-to-end web research workflow testing.",
			"reasoning": "The codebase shows existing MCP infrastructure and web ingestion patterns in mcp/ingest-web-mcp/. This is primarily adaptation work rather than new development. The Docker and service integration aspects add complexity, but the foundation exists."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Subagent Management and Deployment System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create the subagent management system through: subagent lifecycle management implementation with registry-based selection, capabilities matching algorithm development, phase-based deployment system (bootstrap, prd_revision, development, implementation), on-demand activation architecture, core subagent definitions creation (Planner for PRD to task DAG, Architect for ADR management, Backend/Frontend Engineers, Testing Specialists), integration with 100+ community agents from awesome-claude-code-subagents collection, agent customization pipeline development, automated adaptation system, and comprehensive agent lifecycle testing.",
			"reasoning": "The resources/ directory contains extensive subagent collections and the .claude/agents/ structure shows existing agent infrastructure. However, the dynamic deployment, lifecycle management, and integration with 100+ community agents adds significant architectural complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Claude Debugger MCP with QA Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build the QA orchestration system by implementing: Claude Debugger MCP server using Temporal workflow orchestration, QA infrastructure stack setup (Gitea/Forgejo on port 3000, Kiwi TCMS on port 8082, ReportPortal on port 8081, Temporal on port 7233, Langfuse for tracing), simplified task hierarchy implementation (campaign → fix task → bug subtasks), progressive testing system, smart circuit breaking mechanisms, container isolation implementation, Task-master integration for QA task creation and status updates, bug lifecycle management, workflow error handling, and comprehensive QA infrastructure testing.",
			"reasoning": "This requires orchestrating multiple complex systems (Temporal, Gitea, Kiwi TCMS, ReportPortal) with sophisticated workflow management. While the mcp/claude-debugger/ directory shows planning, this involves significant new infrastructure deployment and integration complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Project Memory and Context Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement the Qdrant-based project memory system through: per-project Qdrant collections setup with schema implementation (project, type, tags, stage, summary, content_ref, related_task_ids, timestamps), summary-first retrieval pattern implementation, explicit full content hydration system, memory storage tools development for algorithms/ADRs/decisions/design documents, ingest-web-mcp integration for external content storage, memory querying with filters implementation, semantic search capabilities development, and cross-project isolation testing.",
			"reasoning": "The persistent_memory/ directory structure and existing Qdrant configurations show substantial groundwork. This builds on existing vector store infrastructure (Task 1) and ingest capabilities (Task 5), making it more of an integration and enhancement task rather than ground-up development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement System Prompt Management and Template System",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,

			"reasoning": "The prompts/ directory contains extensive template infrastructure including CLAUDE.md templates and system prompts. This is primarily template management and switching logic rather than complex system development, leveraging existing prompt engineering work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive Testing and Validation Framework",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,

			"reasoning": "Testing framework development that spans multiple complex systems. The codebase shows existing testing patterns and infrastructure, but comprehensive integration testing across all MCP components, workflows, and user journeys requires substantial coordination and test scenario development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and User Experience Polish",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive documentation through: installation and setup procedure documentation, registry configuration guide creation, project initialization workflow documentation, MCP server configuration guide, subagent management documentation, QA infrastructure setup guide, troubleshooting guide development, best practices documentation, README files creation for each MCP component, existing documentation updates, migration guides for existing users, and security considerations documentation.",
			"reasoning": "The resources/ directory contains extensive existing documentation, README files, and the prompts/ directory shows documentation patterns. This is primarily content creation and organization work rather than technical development, though it requires understanding of all system components."
