# ALGO.md - Algorithm Repository

## Purpose

This file maintains a record of all algorithms designed for this project.
Each algorithm should also be stored in the knowledge graph with the tag listed here.

## Active Algorithms

### [Algorithm Name 1]

**Tag**: `algo-[descriptive-name]`
**Created**: [Date]
**Last Modified**: [Date]
**Purpose**: [What problem it solves]
**Performance Requirements**: [User-specified criteria]
**Commit**: [Git hash where it was implemented]

```
[Full algorithm description with all details, edge cases, and implementation notes]

DECISION POINTS:
- [Any trade-offs made with user input]
- [Performance vs accuracy decisions]
- [Scope limitations per user]
```

### [Algorithm Name 2]

**Tag**: `algo-[descriptive-name]`
**Created**: [Date]
**Last Modified**: [Date]
**Purpose**: [What problem it solves]
**Performance Requirements**: [User-specified criteria]
**Commit**: [Git hash where it was implemented]

```
[Full algorithm description]
```

## Deprecated Algorithms

### [Old Algorithm Name]

**Tag**: `algo-[name]-deprecated`
**Deprecated**: [Date]
**Reason**: [Why it was replaced - with user decision]
**Replaced By**: [New algorithm tag]
**Original Commit**: [Git hash]
**Deprecation Commit**: [Git hash]

```
[Original algorithm for reference]
```

## Guidelines

1. **Storage**: Each algorithm must be stored in knowledge graph with exact tag
2. **Detail Level**: Include all implementation details, not summaries
3. **Updates**: When modifying, update both this file and knowledge graph
4. **Deprecation**: Never delete - move to deprecated section with reason
5. **Git Reference**: Always include commit hash for traceability
6. **Decisions**: Document all user decisions that affected the algorithm
